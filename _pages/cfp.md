## Information

We invite submissions to Bialogue, the 29th edition of the SemDial workshop series. This conference brings together researchers working on the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue across diverse disciplines, including formal semantics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.


## Topics

This year, the conference will center around the theme “Meaningful Interaction”. We particularly encourage work that explores this theme, but submissions are welcome from all areas presenting formal, computational, and empirical approaches to the semantics and pragmatics of dialogue, including but not limited to:

- Dynamics of agents' information states in dialogue
- Common ground and mutual belief
- Goals, intentions, and commitments in communication
- Turn-taking and interaction control
- Semantic and pragmatic interpretation in dialogue
- Dialogue and discourse structure
- Categorization of dialogue phenomena in corpora
- Child-adult interaction and language learning through dialogue
- Gesture, gaze, and intonational meaning in communication
- Multimodal dialogue
- Interpretation and reasoning in spoken dialogue systems
- Dialogue management, design, and evaluation
- Modeling miscommunication, disfluency, and repair
- Interdisciplinary perspectives, including enactive and ecological approaches to dialogue
- Applications of innovative theoretical models to dialogue research
