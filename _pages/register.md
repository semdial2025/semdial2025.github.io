### Pricing

The base conference fee (incl. taxes) is **175€**.

Additionally, we ask you to pay for the conference dinner together with the conference fee. The conference dinner will happen at [NUMA](https://numa.de/ 'Link to the restaurant'), a restaurant in Bielefeld. The dinner features an appetiser, a main dish and a dessert. It also includes unlimited water for the evening and one glass of beer/wine/lemonade per person. 

For the main dish, there are two **vegetarian** _(vegetable tikka masala with rice or mushroom ravioli)_ and one **vegan** option _(Indonesian-style wok vegetables with rice)_. Additionally, there are three **meat** options: _grilled-chicken tikka masala with rice, mushroom ravioli with braised Black Angus beef or braised Black Angus beef with potato-swede gratin_. The meat options are 6€ more expensive than the vegetarian/vegan ones. In the registration, we ask you to **commit to one particular price category**, you may, however, make a specific choice for the main dish within this price category on-site.

This amounts to the final fee of **242€** (incl. taxes) for the option with the vegetarian/vegan dinner, and **248€** (incl. taxes) for the option with the non-vegetarian dinner.

### Payment procedure

Once you have submitted your registration form, you will receive an invoice from us with further instructions for payment, sent to the e-mail address you will have given in the registration form. The payment is only possible via **bank transfer**, however, we can cover the transfer fees for attendees who reside in countries outside of SEPA. In order to match the payments to attendees, there is a personalised intended purpose of transfer for everyone that includes the invoice number, therefore, we do not provide generalised payment information here.
